# PermaPass - Decentralised Travel Pass

This project is deployed on [PermaWeb](https://kww6p6mouj6qgbnju7ibakutdca63ddb5v2j27snxo3pjo34jdna.arweave.net/Va3n-Y6ifQMFqafQECqTGIHtjGHtdJ1-Tbu29Lt8SNo/) as well as on [Vercel](https://perma-pass.vercel.app/)


# Problem

The traditional passport and visa process is a challenging and tedious task, people with a long travel history have the burden of maintaining multiple passports for the rest of their lives and if they lose even the passport then it's a hassle to get a duplicate copy of it, they need to go through a long government process and if you lose your passport in a foreign country, then it's even a bigger problem, you're locked in that country.

# Solution

We decided to digitalise this process and make it less hassle-free by creating a digital passport and attaching a travel history to it, this digital passport can then be submitted to Embassies or Consulates that can then grant an e-visa to the person based on their travel history.

The user needs to sign in using Google or another social login, then fill in some basic details, which will then be verified by the government and then a digital passport is generated

This digital passport can be verified on the website, travel history associated with the passport can also be verified and then lastly user can send this passport with their visa application,

The embassy can verify all the details and instead of a traditional sticker visa, an E-Visa will be added to the travel history of the passport holder, this E-Visa entry can be verified by authorities upon arrival in the destination country.

Thus, this provides solutions to individuals as well as government authorities.

# Arweave

Arweave is designed to store things permanently on the internet, thus it is ideal to use in this case as these records are important and must be preserved.

#### NOTE

- I could not add a custom ArNS domain due to insufficient $ArNS tokens, will add it when my wallet gets funded
- This is just the landing page concept, will work on the project if accepted into the Hackathon
